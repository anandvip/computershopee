                <p>This detailed guide takes you step-by-step through automating your computer store business. Think of it as your roadmap to modernizing Computer Shopee in Kurukshetra. Each section below answers important questions and provides clear, actionable advice.

                    <summary class="panel-summary">The Complete Technology Blueprint: What You Need and How It All Works Together</summary>
                    <div class="panel-content">
                        <p>Think of business automation like building a modern house. Just as a house needs electrical wiring, plumbing, and strong foundations all working together, your computer store needs different technology systems that connect and talk to each other seamlessly.</p>

                        <h3>Understanding the Technology Stack</h3>
                        <p>A "technology stack" is simply a collection of software tools and systems that work together to run your business automatically. Imagine it as the invisible workforce that handles repetitive tasks while you focus on growing your business.</p>

                        <h4>1. Your Online Store (E-commerce Platform)</h4>
                        <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This is your digital shop window that customers see online. It's like having a 24/7 salesperson who never gets tired.</p>
                        
                        <div class="example-box">
                            <h5>Real Example:</h5>
                            <p>When a NIT Kurukshetra student searches for "gaming laptop under ₹60,000" at 11 PM, your online store shows them available options, lets them compare features, read reviews, and place an order - all without you being there.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p><strong>Best Options:</strong></p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Shopify:</strong> Easy to use, like using WhatsApp - very user-friendly. Costs around ₹2,000/month but handles everything from payments to security.</li>
                            <li><strong>WooCommerce:</strong> Free to start, but needs more technical setup. Good if you want to save money and have some technical help.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p><strong>Why you need this:</strong> In 2025, customers expect to browse and buy online. Without an online presence, you're missing out on 60% of potential customers in Kurukshetra who prefer to research and buy online.</p>

                        <h4>2. Smart Inventory Management</h4>
                        <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This system automatically tracks every item in your store - when something is sold, it updates your stock count immediately. When stock runs low, it alerts you or even orders more automatically.</p>

                        <div class="workflow-step">
                            <strong>How it works in practice:</strong> A customer buys a Dell laptop from your store. The system immediately reduces your Dell laptop count by 1, updates your website to show the new stock level, and if this was your last Dell laptop, it can automatically send an order to your supplier or alert you to reorder.
                        </div>

                        <p><strong>Best Choice for Kurukshetra:</strong> Zoho Inventory - It's made by an Indian company, costs only ₹1,500/month, works in Hindi and English, and integrates with Tally (which most Indian businesses already use).</p>

                        <h4>3. Point of Sale (POS) System for Your Physical Store</h4>
                        <p><strong>What it does:</strong> This replaces your traditional cash register with a smart system that connects your in-store sales with your online inventory and customer database.</p>

                        <h3>Final Words: Your Legacy Meets the Future</h3>
                        <p>Pawan, your 32 years of dedication have built something special. Computer Shopee isn't just a store - it's a trusted institution in Kurukshetra. Automation doesn't change that legacy; it amplifies it. You're not becoming a tech company - you're becoming a better version of Computer Shopee.</p>

                        <p>The students who buy their first laptops from you, the businesses that trust you with their IT needs, the families who've been customers for generations - they all benefit when you can serve them better, faster, and more efficiently.</p>

                        <div class="example-box">
                            <h4>Your Choice Today Determines Tomorrow:</h4>
                            <p><strong>Option 1:</strong> Continue with manual processes, gradually lose market share to automated competitors, work harder for diminishing returns.</p>
                            <p><strong>Option 2:</strong> Invest in automation, leverage your 32-year reputation with modern efficiency, become Kurukshetra's leading tech retailer, and build a business that can thrive for the next 32 years.</p>
                        </div>

                        <p>The investment is significant, but the cost of not automating is higher. Every month you delay, competitors gain ground, customers shift to online platforms, and opportunities are lost. Your experience and reputation are your biggest assets - now it's time to give them the technological foundation they deserve.</p>
